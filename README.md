# Upanshu's Portfolio

The tech stack I used to make it was: Next.js, Node.js, Tailwind CSS, React.js, and TypeScript.

I learned and used as many best practices for each of these technologies as I could, aiming to sharpen my front-end skillset.

> But it's just a portfolio website!

Sure, but I started with just a blank project and learned so much useful information from reading each tech's documentation to get this to turn out exactly how I wanted it. I'm very confident I have a strong foundation to build much more complex apps now.

## Design Inspiration

I used Figma to prototype the design, based on [Tomasz Gajda's original design](https://www.figma.com/community/file/897605510384968096). I heavily modified it in my own Figma design, and developed it from the ground up after the initial draft.
